> Let's step away from the code for a second and work on the framework design. The goal of this project is to provide a logical organization for steps in an ETL pipeline. It's essentially a configuration layer, allowing the end user to say WHAT they want to happen. Ideally, this framework would be agnostic to WHERE the computation happens, or would even allow users to specify that. For example, having configuration parameters for executing certain steps remotely, or through AWS Lambdas, etc. Can we flesh out some of the design principles of this framework? I want to get it to the stage where I can develop the framework with clear goals and guidelines


Absolutely — stepping back to articulate the **design principles** and **goals** for your framework is the best way to future-proof its direction and keep contributions aligned. Here's a fleshed-out foundation for the **Petal ETL Framework**:

---

## 🌸 **Petal: Design Principles for a Logical ETL Framework**

### 🔑 **Core Vision**

> *Petal is a declarative, composable, execution-agnostic framework for defining ETL pipelines. Its primary goal is to express **what** should happen in a pipeline — not necessarily **how or where** it runs.*

---

## ⚙️ Guiding Principles

### 1. **Declarative and Composable**

* Users should define pipelines in terms of high-level **logical operators**.
* Pipelines are expressed declaratively — through Python, YAML, or other structured formats — using a graph-based abstraction (DAG).
* Operators (`Reader`, `Transformer`, `Writer`, etc.) should be reusable, testable, and composable into arbitrary DAGs.

### 2. **Execution-Agnostic**

* The framework **does not mandate** where or how the computation happens.
* Operators are **pluggable** and can specify their **execution context**:

  * Local (default)
  * Remote execution (e.g., `@remote`, `target=aws_lambda`)
  * Containerized (e.g., Docker)
  * Batch or streaming modes

*Example:*

```yaml
- id: compress
  type: GzipCompressor
  execution:
    backend: aws_lambda
    region: us-east-1
```

### 3. **Extensibility and Plugin-Oriented**

* Users and third parties should be able to develop **new operators** (Sources, Sinks, Transformers) with minimal boilerplate.
* Plugin registration should be automatic or declarative (`@register_plugin`).
* Operator behavior (caching, retrying, failover, etc.) can be customized via metadata.

### 4. **Configuration First**

* YAML, JSON, or TOML should be **first-class citizens** in defining pipelines.
* Rich validation should ensure early feedback (e.g., schema mismatch, missing plugins, invalid DAG).

### 5. **Separation of Concerns**

* The system is logically split into:

  * **Logical Layer** (definition of DAGs and operators)
  * **Execution Layer** (strategies for running operators)
  * **Data Layer** (actual IO sources and sinks)
  * **Metadata Layer** (observability, tracing, lineage)

### 6. **Observability by Default**

* Pipelines should log:

  * Which operator is running
  * Inputs/outputs (with optional truncation)
  * Execution metadata (duration, success/failure, retries)
* Add optional telemetry and runtime diagnostics for advanced users.

## 🎯 Design Goals

| Goal                     | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Declarative**        | Users define *what* to do; the framework handles *how* and *when*.            |
| ✅ **Composable**         | Pipelines are composed of operators that can be reused and rearranged.        |
| ✅ **Modular**            | Every part of the framework is pluggable — operators, runners, serializers.   |
| ✅ **Execution Agnostic** | Users can choose local or remote execution strategies.                        |
| ✅ **Configurable**       | YAML-first interface allows pipelines to be shared, versioned, and validated. |
| ✅ **Transparent**        | Logs and diagnostics are consistent, useful, and centralized.                 |
| ✅ **Testable**           | Logical pipelines can be unit tested, mocked, or dry-run.                     |

## 🧠 Mental Model

Think of Petal as:

* 🧩 A **logical specification layer** for ETL pipelines
* ⚙️ A **plugin runtime** that executes those specifications in various ways
* 🛤 A **conductor** that orchestrates the flow between operators
* 🧱 A **library of reusable operators** (and a registry for custom ones)
* 📁 A **declarative interface** that can be serialized (YAML/JSON) and versioned in Git

---

## 🔮 Future Concepts

Here’s where these principles can lead:

* ✅ Operator decorators like `@remote`, `@cache`, or `@batch`
* ✅ A GUI builder that outputs YAML
* ✅ Pipeline validation (preflight checks)
* ✅ Execution backend plugins: Ray, Celery, Dask, Lambdas, containers
* ✅ Data lineage tracking (audit trail)
* ✅ Cloud-native config (e.g., fetching config from S3, secrets from AWS Secrets Manager)
* ✅ DAG visualizers with interaction

---

## 📘 Development Guidelines

When building or contributing to Petal:

| Principle                  | Design Rule                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep it declarative        | Never require users to explicitly control flow            |
| Prefer configuration       | Expose knobs via config instead of hardcoding             |
| Separate logic & execution | Operator logic shouldn’t depend on where it runs          |
| Keep side effects isolated | IO should be traceable and cacheable                      |
| Make everything testable   | Build pipelines and operators with unit testing in mind   |
| Avoid global state         | Use context objects or dependency injection when possible |

Would you like me to codify this into your repository’s documentation (`DESIGN.md` or `docs/architecture.md`), or turn it into a shareable project charter / roadmap?

> Using these principles, I want you to put together a number of example cases that would demonstrate the ability of this framework. These cases should essentially be work orders to implement an ETL using Petal framework. The cases should be straightforward enough to be understood, and simple enough to be able to achieve, but also should involve different aspects of the intended design. The goal of enumerating these cases is to give a roadmap for the next stage of development for Petal. Make the cases detailed and interesting


Here is a roadmap of **example ETL cases** designed to exercise and demonstrate Petal’s architecture, extensibility, execution abstraction, and config-first design principles.

These cases are intentionally scoped to cover *increasing levels of complexity*, encourage plugin development, and exercise diverse aspects of Petal’s intended use.

---

## 🌱 Stage 1: Core Capabilities (Local, In-Memory Execution)

### ✅ Case 1: No-Op Pipeline (Validation Only)

**Goal**: Validate that a pipeline can be constructed and traversed end-to-end.

**Description**:

* Use a dummy `EmptySource` that returns an empty list.
* Pipe it to a `NoOpTransformer` and then to a `NoOpSink`.

**Why it matters**: Exercises DAG creation, operator registry, pipeline context, and topological execution.

---

### ✅ Case 2: File Reader → Regex Filter → File Writer

**Goal**: Ingest a local file, filter lines matching a pattern, write to output file.

**Operators**:

* `FileReader(file_path)`
* `RegexFilter(pattern=r'^ERROR')`
* `FileWriter(file_path)`

**YAML Config**:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: reader
    type: FileReader
    params: { file_path: input.txt }

  - id: filter
    type: RegexFilter
    params: { pattern: '^ERROR' }

  - id: writer
    type: FileWriter
    params: { file_path: output.txt }

edges:
  - [reader, filter]
  - [filter, writer]
```

**Why it matters**: Covers file IO, transformation, and YAML-based composition.

---

## 🌿 Stage 2: Branching, Merging, and Data Fan-Out

### ✅ Case 3: Split File Into Two Filters

**Goal**: Fan out a file source to two separate transformers and sinks.

**Topology**:

```
FileReader
   └────┬────┐
   ↓    ↓    ↓
Regex1 Regex2 Regex3
   ↓     ↓    ↓
File1 File2 File3
```

**Why it matters**: Tests `Splitter`, DAG fan-out, operator memoization, multiple sink coordination.

---

### ✅ Case 4: Merge Sources from Two Files

**Goal**: Read two files, merge lines, write to a single sink.

**Operators**:

* `FileReader(file_a.txt)`
* `FileReader(file_b.txt)`
* `ListMerger` (combines two input lists)
* `FileWriter`

**Why it matters**: Tests multi-input operator, upstream joins, and execution order resolution.

---

## 🌺 Stage 3: Custom Operators and Plugin Extensions

### ✅ Case 5: Add Timestamp to Lines

**Goal**: Create a `TimestampAppender` operator that adds current timestamp to each line.

**Operator logic**:

```python
def process(lines):
    return [f"{datetime.now().isoformat()} - {line}" for line in lines]
```

**Why it matters**: Demonstrates how to create new logical operators and plugin registration.

---

### ✅ Case 6: JSON File Reader + Key Extractor

**Goal**: Read JSON lines, extract specific fields, write a summary file.

**Operators**:

* `JsonFileReader`
* `KeyExtractor(keys=["timestamp", "level"])`
* `CsvWriter`

**Why it matters**: Introduces JSON parsing, data shape transformations, and tabular sink.

---

## 🌸 Stage 4: Remote or Simulated Execution

### ✅ Case 7: AWS Lambda-Backed Transformer

**Goal**: Allow a step to run via AWS Lambda using `execution: {backend: aws_lambda}`.

**Pipeline**:

* `FileReader`
* `SentimentAnalyzer (remote)`
* `FileWriter`

**Why it matters**: Exercises execution abstraction and backend routing.

---

### ✅ Case 8: Dockerized Operator (e.g. NLP)

**Goal**: Execute a CPU-heavy transformation in a container.

**Execution Block**:

```yaml
execution:
  backend: docker
  image: myorg/nlp-tools:latest
  entrypoint: analyze_text.py
```

**Why it matters**: Validates backend flexibility and data marshaling.

---

## 🌻 Stage 5: Observability, Caching, and Robust Execution

### ✅ Case 9: Pipeline with Caching and Retry Logic

**Goal**: Enable `cache_io: true`, force a retry for a flaky operator.

**Operators**:

* `FlakyTransformer` (randomly fails)
* `RetryWrapper` (retries up to 3 times)

**YAML**:

```yaml
cache_io: true
nodes:
  - id: flaky
    type: FlakyTransformer
    params: {}
    retry: 3
```

**Why it matters**: Enables caching layer and fault tolerance.

---

## 🧩 Stage 6: Composite Pipelines and Nesting

### ✅ Case 10: Reusable Pipeline Module

**Goal**: Define a reusable pipeline “macro” that can be reused in others.

**Concept**:

```yaml
modules:
  - id: preprocessor
    path: preprocessing.yaml

edges:
  - [preprocessor.output, main_writer]
```

**Why it matters**: Paves the way for modular, composable pipeline libraries.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: "Dry Run" and Debug Visualization

### ✅ Case 11: Dry Run + ASCII DAG Printout

**Goal**: Enable `.run(dry=True)` and print an ASCII-art DAG.

```
Pipeline: extract_logs
[reader] ──▶ [filter] ──▶ [sink]
```

**Why it matters**: Aids debugging, documentation, and usability.

---

## 🔭 Next Steps

Each case can now become:

* A **unit test**
* A **real YAML file**
* An **example CLI command**
* A **documentation showcase**
* A **CI validation step**

Would you like me to generate a folder of `examples/` with YAMLs + scripts for these now, or scaffold the issue tracker into epics/stories using these cases?

> How would the user interact with things like the backend? For example, if I have a pipeline that runs some steps locally and some steps on an AWS lambda, how would the user specify that? And then how should the framework handle that logic to ensure that both the local and cloud computations are done correctly and communicate within the pipeline process? 

Great question. This gets to the heart of one of Petal’s key design goals: **decoupling the *definition* of an ETL pipeline from its *execution* environment**. Below is a detailed breakdown of how this could work.

---

## 🧭 User Interaction with Backends

### ✅ 1. **User-facing abstraction: Declarative `execution` block**

Each operator in the pipeline YAML (or programmatic config) can optionally declare an `execution` config that describes *how and where* it should run.

### 🔧 Example YAML

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: reader
    type: FileReader
    params: { file_path: "input.txt" }

  - id: lambda_transform
    type: SentimentAnalyzer
    execution:
      backend: aws_lambda
      function_name: petal-sentiment-analyze
      region: us-east-1

  - id: writer
    type: FileWriter
    params: { file_path: "output.txt" }

edges:
  - [reader, lambda_transform]
  - [lambda_transform, writer]
```

---

## ⚙️ Framework Responsibility

Petal's execution engine needs to adapt operator *dispatch logic* to support arbitrary backend types. Here's how to structure that internally:

---

## 🧩 2. **Operator Dispatch Mechanism**

### Each operator has:

* `.process()` method (used in local execution)
* An optional `.execute_remote()` method
* A dispatcher in the core framework that chooses which to use based on the `execution` config

```python
def execute_operator(node, inputs, execution_config):
    backend = execution_config.get("backend", "local")
    
    if backend == "local":
        return node.process(*inputs)
    elif backend == "aws_lambda":
        return invoke_lambda(node, inputs, execution_config)
    elif backend == "docker":
        return invoke_docker_container(node, inputs, execution_config)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown backend: {backend}")
```

---

## 🧪 3. **Backend Adapters / Executors**

Each backend gets its own thin executor class or function:

### ✅ Lambda Example

```python
def invoke_lambda(node, inputs, config):
    payload = {
        "inputs": inputs,
        "operator_id": node.operator_id,
        "type": node.__class__.__name__,
    }
    return boto3.client('lambda', region_name=config['region']).invoke(
        FunctionName=config['function_name'],
        InvocationType='RequestResponse',
        Payload=json.dumps(payload),
    )['Payload'].read()
```

### ✅ Docker Example

```python
def invoke_docker_container(node, inputs, config):
    docker_image = config["image"]
    entrypoint = config["entrypoint"]

    subprocess.run([
        "docker", "run", "--rm", "-i", docker_image, entrypoint
    ], input=json.dumps(inputs).encode())
```

---

## 🧠 4. **Serialization + Transport**

The framework must **serialize operator inputs/outputs** to a format suitable for transport (e.g. JSON), and define a simple schema for remote runners to deserialize.

```json
{
  "inputs": ["some text"],
  "operator_id": "lambda_transform",
  "type": "SentimentAnalyzer"
}
```

Remote runner invokes `.process()` and returns output (also serialized).

---

## 🔁 5. **Hybrid DAG Execution**

Since Petal executes pipelines in **topological order**, hybrid DAGs with mixed backends work naturally. The operator dispatcher checks the backend config on each node and routes the execution accordingly.

* Inputs to a remote operator are gathered from local results
* Outputs from a remote call are cached in memory or disk (if `cache_io` is enabled)
* Downstream operators are fed the results, regardless of execution source

---

## 👩‍💻 Developer Experience

* ✅ The user **only writes a declarative pipeline** with backends per node.
* ✅ Operators **don’t need to know** how they are dispatched — they just implement `process()`.
* ✅ Plugins can optionally register remote handlers.

---

## 🔐 Optional Features

* 🔁 Retry failed remote calls (Lambda, Docker)
* 🔒 Signed payloads for secured execution
* ⏱️ Timeout settings per operator
* ☁️ Remote caching (e.g., S3-backed `cache_io`)

---

## 🚀 Summary: Key Design Tenets for Multi-Backend Execution

| Principle                   | Mechanism                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Separation of concerns**  | Operators define logic, backends handle execution                      |
| **Pluggable backends**      | Use `execution.backend` field in config                                |
| **Serialization boundary**  | JSON-based data exchange between operators and backends                |
| **Runtime dispatching**     | Core pipeline checks config and routes operator execution              |
| **Composable DAGs**         | Hybrid DAGs work via standard topological sort and context passing     |
| **Remote execution safety** | Idempotency, retries, and memoization help guard distributed execution |

Would you like a prototype of this runtime dispatch system in Python, including the `execution` config handling and lambda/docker adapter stubs?
